***** Sponsor Manager Version 1.01 *****

This file is meant to provide specific instructions and documentation
for working with the Sponsor Manager program.

Initially there will be a login screen.  Enter your credentials: user-name and password.
If either of these are not found in the database, the program will ask you to try again.
Upon successful login, the main screen will be displayed.

Menu bar options include:
Team Members:  This option will allow you to see the team members that contributed to the project
in a message box ... click the 'OK' button to return to the program.

About:  This option will allow you to see this file in a new window ... click the 'X' in the
upper right corner of the window to return to the program.

Exit:  This option allows you to exit the program ... you will be prompted by a message box to
confirm that you really want to quit the program ... clicking 'YES' ends the program.

Once into the main program, you will see buttons along the left side of the window
and an output box adjacent and to the right of the buttons.
The buttons contain the functionality for the program so far.  The main functionality
is as follows:

Sponsors: This button will execute the SQL statement 'SELECT * FROM sponsors'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be
all fields from the Sponsors table.

Membership: This button will execute the SQL statement 'SELECT * FROM Membership_level'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be
all fields from the Membership_level table.

Membership Level: This button will execute the SQL statement
'SELECT Membership_level FROM Membership_level'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be only the
Membership_level field from the Membership_level table.

Sponsor Names: This button will execute the SQL statement 'SELECT Sponsor_Name FROM sponsors'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be
only the Sponsor_name field from the Sponsors table.

Payment Received: This button will execute the SQL statement
'SELECT * FROM sponsors WHERE Payment_Received = "Yes"'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be
the entire record from the Sponsors table if that sponsor has paid in full.

Payment Not Received: This button will execute the SQL statement
'SELECT * FROM sponsors WHERE Payment_Received = "No"'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be
the entire record from the Sponsors table if that sponsor has not paid in full.

The following buttons are disabled at this time.  The functionality described below
will be added in the next update to the program.

Sponsor Level: This button will execute the SQL statement
'SELECT Sponsors.Sponsor_Name, Membership_level.Membership_level
FROM Sponsors JOIN Sponsors.Membership_ID ON Membership_level.Membership_ID'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be
the Sponsor Name and Membership Level for each sponsor in the Sponsors table.

Membership Cost: This button will execute the SQL statement
'SELECT Sponsors.Sponsor_Name, Membership_level.Membership_cost
FROM Sponsors JOIN Membership_level.Membership_ID ON Sponsors.Membership_id'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be
the Sponsor Name and Membership Cost for each sponsor in the Sponsors table.

Membership Renewal: This button will execute the SQL statement
'SELECT Sponsors.Sponsor_Name, Membership_level.Membership_renewal, Membership_level.Membership_cost
FROM Sponsors JOIN Membership_level.Membership_ID ON Sponsors.Membership_id'.
The resulting output will be sent to the output box.  The output should be
the Sponsor Name, Membership Renewal frequency, and Membership Cost
for each sponsor in the Sponsors table.

To exit this window, click the 'X' in the upper right corner of the window.
